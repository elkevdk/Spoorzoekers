Project Assignment: Optimizing Intercity Train Lining System

Goal: Develop a heuristic in Python to generate an optimal train lining system for intercity trains. The goal is to maximize the overall quality of the train lining system based on the given objective function.

The quality K of the train lining system is defined by:
K=p√ó10000‚àí(T√ó100+Min)
where:
- p is the fraction of the used connections.
- T is the number of used pathways.
- Min is the total time in minutes of all used pathways.

Conditions:
Each pathway has a maximum time length.
The train lining system has a maximum number of pathways.
Task: Create a heuristic algorithm in Python that maximizes the objective function ùêæ while adhering to the given conditions.

# Method

# Testing
